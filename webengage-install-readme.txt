3. **Drive conversion and push sales on your website using our in-site notifications**. You can use notifications to offer discount code, push a feature update message to all your visitors or announce a downtime on your website. You can target these messages at specific audiences on your website to create an effective campaign. We offer powerful analytics for each of your notifications including statistics like clickthrough rates, country wise distribution etc.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. **Is WebEngage FREE to use?** - <strong>Yes</strong>. A feedback form with auto-screengrab feature, unlimited feedback queries and responses every month, short survey with limited number of responses and targeting capabilities - all these are FREE forever. Of-course, if you need more, we have some other cool features for which you can upgrade to our [premium plans](http://webengage.com/pricing).

2. **The feedback tab shows up on my website. However, upon clicking, it displays an error message instead of the feedback form. Why?** - Most likely because the domain name for which you created the widget does not match with the one you are using it on. If you are keen to test WebEngage in test/dev environment, please create a separate widget with "localhost" or a corresponding domain name. Use the corresponding license code in your plugin to test locally.

3. **What all information does WebEngage capture?** - Apart from the answers to questions in your forms (both feedback and survey) and a screengrab of the page on which the feedback was submitted on, we automatically capture a whole bunch of other information. E.g. Geo location (and IP) of the user submitting feedback, Date/time, Page URL on which the feedback was submitted, Browser, Operating Platform etc. You get to see all of these in the email notification as well as in your WebEngage dashboard.

4. **Can I add custom fields to the feedback form?** - <strong>Yes</strong>. With [paid plans](http://webengage.com/pricing) (starting $15/month), you can add your own fields to the feedback form - checkboxes, radio buttons, input boxes, comment boxes, files, dropdowns etc. This can be done using a simple drag-n-drop form builder inside WebEngage dashboard. You don't need to write any code whatsoever.

5. **Is WebEngage spam-free?** - <strong>Yes</strong>. Our technology makes sure that only humans can submit the feedback form on your website. And we do that without asking your users to read through an unreadable CAPTCHA image :). Our stuff just works!

6. **Can data be exported from WebEngage?** - <strong>Yes</strong>. You can download all your feedback in Excel format in realtime. Responses to all your surveys can be downloaded in similar fashion. Very soon, we'll release our API which will make it easier to push all the WebEngage data into your favourite CRM.

7. **What other customizations are possible?** - Far too many! All email templates, stylesheets, logos etc can all be changed depending upon the [plan](http://webengage.com/pricing) you choose.


For any other question(s), please email us on support {at} webengage dot com or [contact us](http://webengage.com/contact). We assure you of a quick revert.
